Welcome on my personal web page! I'm **Kevin Gobron** (he/him), an early career geodesist who loves developing data analysis methods to image the Earth's dynamic better. I'm currently a postdoc within the geodesy team of the Globe's Physics Institute in Paris (IPGP).

My current research focuses on developing statistical methods devoted to **realistic uncertainty assessment** to improve the description of geophysical signals. I'm also interested in refining **data combination/assimilation** strategies, which benefits many geodetic and geophysical applications by pushing further the limits of geodetic systems' accuracy.

Currently, my research directly contributes to the scientific applications of **Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)** and **Terrestrial Reference Frames (TRF)**. Yet, I'm also seeking to play a role in more geophysics-oriented topics, such as *seismo-tectonics*, *marine geodesy*, *sea-level change*, and *hydrogeodesy*.
