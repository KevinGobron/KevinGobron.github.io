I'm an early career geodesist who loves developing data analysis methods to image the Earth's dynamic better. I'm currently a postdoc within the geodesy team of the Globe's Physics Institute in Paris (IPGP).

My current research focuses on improving statistical methods devoted to **realistic uncertainty assessment** to improve the description of **geophysical signals**. I'm also interested in developing *data combination/assimilation* strategies, which benefits many geodetic and geophysical applications by pushing further the limits of geodetic systems' accuracy.

Currently, my research directly contributes to the scientific applications of **Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)** and **Terrestrial Reference Frames (TRF)**. However, I'm also seeking to play a role in more geophysics-oriented fields, such as geodynamic and sea-level change researchs.
