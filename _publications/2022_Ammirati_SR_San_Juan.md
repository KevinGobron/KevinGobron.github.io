excerpt: 'Understanding the mechanisms of crustal deformation along convergent margins is critical to identifying seismogenic structures and assessing earthquake hazards for nearby urban centers. 
In the southern central Andes (28–33 \°S), differences in the style of middle to upper-crustal deformation and associated seismicity are highlighted by the January 19th, 2021 (Mw 6.5) San Juan earthquake. 
We integrate waveforms recorded at regional and teleseismic distances with co-seismic displacements calculated from local Global Navigation Satellite System time series,
to re-estimate the source parameters of the 2021 San Juan earthquake, confirming a mid-crustal nucleation depth (21 ± 2 km) and right-lateral transpressional mechanism.
Considered alongside decades of seismic observations and geological data, this event provides evidence for retroarc deformation partitioning among inherited basement
faults and upper-crustal structures in response to oblique convergence of the Nazca and South American plates. 
As they may transfer shortening to active upper-crustal faults associated with
historically devastating shallower earthquakes, a better understanding of 
seismogenic basement faults such as the mid-crustal structure activated during the
2021 San Juan earthquake earthquake could help future re-assessment of the
seismic risk in western Argentina.'
